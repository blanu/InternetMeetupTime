Internet Meetup Time (IMT) is a global time for the Internet, inspired by Swatch
Internet Time (SIT), but improved. Similar to SIT, there are no time zones or
daylight savings time. A time is the same everywhere on Earth, therefore it
is ideal for specifying times for meeting up with people on the Internet.

SIT had two problems. The first is that it used Biel Mean Time (BMT) instead of
UTC as the base time zone. This makes it more difficult to calculate from
Unix time. Second, it subdivided the day into 1000 "beats". This was useful
in that a time is a single number from to 0 to 999, making it easy to find
the difference between two times. However, beats are awkward to use because
they do not map easily to seconds.

In contrast to SIT, IMT uses UTC as the base time zone. Additionally, instead
of dividing the day into 1000 beats, the day is divided into 864 parts of 100 
seconds. The time of day can be easily computed by (unix time % 86400)/100.

Finally, there is the issue of how to indicate that times are in IMT. SIT times
were prepended with an '@', for instance '@724'. IMT times should similarly
be prepended with a '~', such as '~724'. For extra emphasis, this could
be written as '~724 IMT'.

Included is a small curses clock in Python that displays time in IMT.

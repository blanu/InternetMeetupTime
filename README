Internet Meetup Time (IMT) is a global time for the Internet, inspired by Swatch
Internet Time (SIT), but improved. Similar to SIT, there are no time zones or
daylight savings time. A time is the same everywhere on Earth, therefore it
is ideal for specifying times for meeting up with people on the Internet.

SIT had two problems. The first is that it used Biel Mean Time (BMT) instead of
UTC as the base time zone. This makes it more difficult to calculate from
Unix time. Second, it subdivided the day into 1000 "beats". This was useful
in that a time is a single number from to 0 to 999, making it easy to find
the difference between two times. However, beats are awkward to use because
they do not map easily to seconds.

In contrast to SIT, IMT uses UTC as the base time zone. Additionally, instead
of dividing the day into 1000 beats, the day is divided into 86400 seconds. The
time of day can be easily computed by unix time % 86400. The time is
additionally punctuated with colons in normal time form. For instance, 74126
seconds would be written 7:41:26. A "minute" therefore consists of 100 actual
seconds. An "hour" consists of 100 "minutes", or 10,000 actual seconds.

Careful readers will note that this yields an 8-hour day with 6,400 unaccounted
seconds. Indeed, there is a 9th hour consisting of on 6,400 seconds instead of
10,000. While this would be challenging when developing a mechanical analog
clock, it poses no challenges whatsoever to digital clocks and only a slight
problem to digital renditions of analog clocks. For the latter I recommend that
the extra 6,400 seconds is labeled as "bonus time" and made to seem exciting.

Finally, there is the issue of how to indicate that times are in IMT. SIT times
were prepended with an '@', for instance '@724'. IMT times should similarly
be prepended with a '~', such as '~7:46:19'. For extra emphasis, this could
be written as '~7:46:19 IMT'.

Included in this distribution is a small curses clock in Python that displays
time in IMT.
